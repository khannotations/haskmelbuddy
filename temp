IT FELT ALMOST UNHUMAN, systematically crushing, shattering, melting and documenting dozens of cookies and candies. Some played nice; others took more firepower to subdue, but eventually all revealed their intricate insides. 

This collection plays on the strangeness of mutilating such sweet and delicate objects. The process exposed the stuff that actually makes them delicious: not their wrapper or shape, but their texture and engineered makeup. But while I expected that reducing these sweets to blobs, structures and smears would disenchant me from their tastes, I found myself enticed by their complexity.
